# Scrape_Tesla3_ProductionRate

Use python to get the weekly Tesla Model 3 production and email it to your email address.

You also need a file "config.py" which stores you gmail address and password (suggest you register a new gmail for this). The "config.py" file contains only two lines of code as follows:

EMAIL_ADDRESS  = "yourgmail@gmail.com"

PASSWORD = "yourpassword"
